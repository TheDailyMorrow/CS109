This code is written for a challenge project for CS 109 Winter 2022 at Stanford University. This program
reads in movie data from a .csv file modified from the the following source:
https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/version/7?select=movies_metadata.csv
The function catalogues movie information about budge, revenue, runtime, release date and then determines
if there exists a correlation between these parameters and the movies' rating.
Bootstrapping is used to determine if the difference in rating mean is significant.
